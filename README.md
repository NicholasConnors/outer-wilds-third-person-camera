# Outer Wilds Third Person Camera

![3rd person](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/142057019-e2dcca28-6838-4b94-b45a-29843d44ab62.png)

Press V or the left directional button (Gamepad) to toggle between 1st and 3rd person.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out.

TODO:
- SignalScope frequency and map HUD don't work with helmet on
- Add lock-on UI in 3rd person

Known issues:
- NomaiAudioVolume's leave their last message on screen when you go to translate something else.

Wishlist (would be nice):
- Free rotate camera 360 and with player camera (not just ship).
- Actually catch fire in fires
- Allow 3rd person in the dream (need a new player model)
- Make signalscope, probe launcher work in ship (add GUI to screen)
