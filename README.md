# Outer Wilds Third Person Camera

Alternatively, press V or the left analog stick to toggle between 1st and 3rd person.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out.

Current issues:

I have it bring you back to first person currently when using tools. This includes artifacts/lanterns/scrolls/etc and I'd rather those work in 3rd person.
The player can see ghost matter in 3rd person
Probes are invisible in 3rd person
