Press V or the left directional button to toggle between 1st and 3rd person.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out.

TODO:
- Helmet HUD doesnt update in 3rd person (disabled for now)
- Add HUD markers in 3rd person
- Add translator text to screen in 3rd person
- Add ship navigation text to screen in 3rd person

Wishlist (would be nice):
- Remove crosshair
- Free rotate camera 360 and with player camera (not just ship).
- Actually catch fire in fires
- Allow 3rd person in the dream (need a new player model)
