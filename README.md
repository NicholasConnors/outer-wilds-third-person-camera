Press V or the left directional button (Gamepad) to toggle between 1st and 3rd person. If you rebind the X axis option for tools then it changes to whatever that is.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out. There are options in settings to change the default zoom (useful when on controller since you can't scroll).

There are a few settings in the options menu:
- Keep free look angle: You can freelook around your character while holding alt or the downward direction button (Gamepad). Toggling this option keeps the camera at that angle when you let go.
- Use 3rd person by default: Determines if you start the game in 1st or 3rd person.

To make your own camera mods you should use [Common Camera Utility](https://github.com/xen-42/ow-common-camera-util/) just like this mod does.
