# Outer Wilds Third Person Camera

![3rd person OWDB thumbnail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/146269240-54a849d0-1190-4fd5-bbca-3d5f885fd246.png)

Press V or the left directional button (Gamepad) to toggle between 1st and 3rd person. If you rebind the X axis option for tools then it changes to whatever that is.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out. There are options in settings to change the default zoom (useful when on controller since you can't scroll).

There are a few settings in the options menu:
- Keep free look angle: You can freelook around your character while holding alt or the downward direction button (Gamepad). Toggling this option keeps the camera at that angle when you let go.
- Use 3rd person by default: Determines if you start the game in 1st or 3rd person.
- Use custom dreamer model: I made a custom model for a specific part of the game, since it's not native to OW you can disable it if you want.
