# Outer Wilds Third Person Camera

![3rd person](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/142057019-e2dcca28-6838-4b94-b45a-29843d44ab62.png)

Press V or the left directional button (Gamepad) to toggle between 1st and 3rd person.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out.

TODO:
- Make signalscope, probe launcher work in ship (need to add GUI)

Known issues:
- HUD way too big at low screen resolution
- SignalScope frequency and map HUD don't show in third person
- Solanum's rocks textures get messed up when switching cameras

Wishlist (would be nice):
- Actually catch fire in fires
- Allow 3rd person in the dream (need a new player model)
