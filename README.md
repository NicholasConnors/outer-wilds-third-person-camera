# Outer Wilds Third Person Camera

![3rd person OWDB thumbnail](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/143732128-63ef39dc-a48c-4648-b109-855e37526776.png)

Press V or the left directional button (Gamepad) to toggle between 1st and 3rd person.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out.

There are two settings in the options menu:
- Keep free look angle: You can freelook around your character while holding alt or the downward direction button (Gamepad). Toggling this option keeps the camera at that angle when you let go.
- Use 3rd person by default: Determines if you start the game in 1st or 3rd person.

Known issues:
- Can target self with autopilot
- Tools rotate with you when using free look

Wishlist (would be nice):
- Allow 3rd person in the dream (need a new player model)
