Press V or the left directional button (Gamepad) to toggle between 1st and 3rd person.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out.

TODO:
- Make signalscope, probe launcher work in ship (need to add GUI)

Known issues:
- HUD way too big at low screen resolution
- SignalScope frequency and map HUD don't show in third person
- Solanum's rocks textures get messed up when switching cameras

Wishlist (would be nice):
- Actually catch fire in fires
- Allow 3rd person in the dream (need a new player model)
