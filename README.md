# Outer Wilds Third Person Camera

![3rd person](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/142057019-e2dcca28-6838-4b94-b45a-29843d44ab62.png)

Press V or the left directional button to toggle between 1st and 3rd person.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out.

TODO:
- SignalScope frequency and map HUD don't work with helmet on
- Add lock-on UI in 3rd person
- Make code not be spaghetti

Known issues:
- Putting a scroll into a wall doesn't count as unequiping it (materials aren't reset)
- Nomai tapes don't read in 3rd person
- Translator text appears on screen even in first person
- Raycast collides with inivisble walls sometimes
- Toggling camera mode while moving Nomai orbs is broken

Wishlist (would be nice):
- Free rotate camera 360 and with player camera (not just ship).
- Actually catch fire in fires
- Allow 3rd person in the dream (need a new player model)
- Make signalscope, probe launcher work in ship (add GUI to screen)
