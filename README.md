# Outer Wilds Third Person Camera

![3rd person](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22628069/142057019-e2dcca28-6838-4b94-b45a-29843d44ab62.png)

Press V or the left analog stick to toggle between 1st and 3rd person.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out.

Current issues:

- I have it bring you back to first person currently when using tools. This includes artifacts/lanterns/scrolls/etc and I'd rather those work in 3rd person.

- Waking up on the stranger puts you in first person even though you're holding a tool

- The player can see ghost matter in 3rd person.

- Probes are invisible in 3rd person.

- Haven't tried it yet but I bet the statue gets weird

- Should probably remove the crosshair eh
