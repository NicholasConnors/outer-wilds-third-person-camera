Press V or the left analog stick to toggle between 1st and 3rd person.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out.

Current issues:

- Artifacts appear ontop of you

- Stranger dreams don't do the thing when you do the one thing

- The player can see ghost matter in 3rd person.

- Probes are invisible in 3rd person.

- Statue doesn't re-enable 3rd person after uplink

- Should probably remove the crosshair eh
