Press V or the left directional button (Gamepad) to toggle between 1st and 3rd person.

Scroll in/out to zoom in/out.

Known issues:
- HUD way too big at low screen resolution
- SignalScope frequency and minimap don't show in third person
- Tool rotate with you when using free look

Wishlist (would be nice):
- Actually catch fire in fires
- Allow 3rd person in the dream (need a new player model)
- Make projection pools work in 3D
